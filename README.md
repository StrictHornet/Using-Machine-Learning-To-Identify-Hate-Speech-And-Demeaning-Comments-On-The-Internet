# Using-Machine-Learning-To-Identify-Hate-Speech-And-Demeaning-Comments-On-The-Internet
Repo For Social Project

Great strides in computer science have always led to simpler living, however, these advancements 
did not come without much-needed intervention through people who raised an equally much 
needed awareness of the problems at hand. Through this synergy of problem identification and 
problem resolution we have created a more convenient world. We cannot stop now.  The internet 
has brought about connectedness and has been a key element in the advancement of technology, 
however, we are at a junction where the rate at which toxic data being uploaded on the internet is
 surpassing our ability to moderate toxic altercations  [1][2]. Human moderators that regulate toxic 
content on the internet are having to endure challenging workloads and being diagnosed with 
mental health illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic anxiety. The normalization 
of toxicity on the internet is autocatalytic as it originates more toxicity and thus demands abrupt 
action  [3]. This project aims to raise awareness of these alarming levels of toxicity and hate 
speech, highlight the impact of this toxicity on the mental health of internet users and moderators 
and put to light the current measures being taken to mitigate these trying state of affairs. This 
project would also address how Artificial Intelligence in the form of Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) is impacting this alarming development through the design and comparative analysis of 
several machine learning models to underline the progress of NLP research. Addressing real-world 
topics such as mental health requires the highest level of academic honesty and integrity. As such, 
this project would abide to the highest ethical standards to avoid unexpected negative 
consequences.  Finally, it will aim to accomplish the objective of accentuating the importance of 
research on  this problem and most importantly stress the need for creating a clean social 
environment on the internet using machine learning.
